# Azure Web PubSub service simple chat app with Azure Static Web App service

[Azure Web PubSub](https://aka.ms/awps) helps you build real-time messaging web applications using WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern easily. This real-time functionality allows publishing content updates between server and connected clients (for example a single page web application or mobile application). The clients do not need to poll the latest updates, or submit new HTTP requests for updates. And with [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) you can automatically build and deploy full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.

Use this repo template you can easily create and deploy a real-time message chat app in minutes.
